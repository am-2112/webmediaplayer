# webmediaplayer
Creating a web media player for local music playback, as well as displaying songs available on the server.


The user can play their sound files locally by 'uploading' them to the site client-side and the files will be loaded into the site locally.
The media player will support all standard things like playlists, randomisers, and favourited songs.
If only playing locally, then cookies and such can be saved on the client's machine to save said playlists and such (to avoid managing storage for the web server).
The user can also use a search bar to look through songs available on the webserver, which will be loaded async (ajax).
