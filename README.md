# webmediaplayer
Creating a web media player for local music playback and optional log-in to music services like soundcloud


The user can play their sound files locally by 'uploading' them to the site client-side and the files will be loaded into the site visually locally
The media player will support all standard things like playlists, randomisers, and favourited songs
If only playing locally, then cookies and such can be saved on the client's machine to save said playlists and such (to avoid managing storage for the web server)
It will also allow the user to log into sites like soundcloud, where it will render that website within a portion of this one (ie. without changing the url)
  From there, the user will be able to download selected / liked files from those sites onto their machine (if they have the needed requirements such as Soundcloud Go+ for downloading licensed songs)
